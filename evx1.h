// Description:
//
//   EVX-1 is a branch of the P.264 video codec that was developed from 2009-2010 
//   as part of the everyAir mobile cloud gaming project.
//
//   Unlike P.264, which focused on efficient low latency video compression, EVX-1 
//   was designed as a basic platform for experimentation. As a result, EVX-1 is 
//   slow, lacks many modern features, and has limited platform support. In exchange 
//   for these limitations however, EVX-1 is significantly easier to tweak, analyze,
//   and debug than its predecessor.
