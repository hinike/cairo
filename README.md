## Cairo Experimental Video Codec
Cairo is a simple streaming video codec that was created as part of the [everyAir mobile cloud gaming project](http://www.everyair.net). Its original purpose was to help us experiment with low latency game streaming on early mobile hardware (original iPad, iPhone 3GS). Using a heavily tuned implementation, Cairo enabled everyAir to stream PC, Mac, and even PS3 games to iOS devices with extremely low encode and decode latencies.

### Open Source Release
This release contains an early and *unoptimized* version of Cairo that demonstrates the basic functionality of the codec. 
Cairo's new purpose is to serve as an educational resource for students who are interested in video compression. This release presents a simple and easy to read implementation that demonstrates several common techniques without the complexities of optimizations or platform dependencies.

### Caution: patent hazard
Note that while this release is provided under an open and permissive copyright license, the algorithms it contains are likely to be covered by existing patents that may restrict your ability to use this codec commercially.
